#+title: Disco Ef Themes
#+date: [2023-12-04 Mon]

The [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes][Ef (εὖ/good) Themes]] package by Protesilaos Stavrou (Prot) provides colorful and legible themes.

The package detects whether the current theme is a light or dark theme of the Ef variety and then picks a random light or dark theme.

This frivolous package can also automatically change themes at a defined interval, creating a Ef Themes disco!

* Installation and configuration
Download the =disco-ef-themes.el= file and store it in your preferred location. This ~use-package~ declaration loads the theme and starts the disco by changing themes every 10 seconds.

You can change the interval with the ~disco-ef-themes-interval~ variable.

#+begin_src elisp :results none :tangle no
  (use-package disco-ef-themes
    :load-path "~/.config/emacs/" ;; Change as required
    :custom
    (disco-ef-themes-interval 10)
    :bind
    (("<f12>"   . disco-ef-themes-load-random)
     ("M-<f12>" . disco-ef-themes)
     ("C-<f12>" . disco-ef-themes-change-shade)))
#+end_src

- =C-F12= toggles between dark and light themes
